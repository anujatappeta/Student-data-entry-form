# Student-data-entry-form
This Python script creates a GUI data entry form using Tkinter, allowing users to input personal and course information. The entered data is validated and, upon acceptance of terms, stored in an SQLite database named 'data.db'. The script ensures that all necessary fields are completed before saving the data.
